    "There are a lot of factors that go into making a big move, and for many people, the top priority is either their job or their family. But if you’re on your own and you have job flexibility to go basically wherever you want (i.e. you work remotely), then what? In that case, you have the luxury of finding a place that suits you—and not necessarily just your career.\n",

    "A myriad of decisions go into picking the perfect place to call home — political leanings, crime rates, walkability, affordability, religious affiliations, weather and more — can you make a tool that allows aggie graduates and others to find thier next move?\n",
    "\n",
    "[High speed internet](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/best-cities-to-live-work-remotely) (of all people?!) made a tool to do this.... but you can do better! Think of more factors: like median income of a location, cuisine, primary ethnicity, pollution index, happiness index, number of coffee shops or microbreweries in the city, etc. There's no end! Furthermore, maybe you are an international student and want to make this tool for global placement! Go for it! Maybe you want to penalize distance from POI's (points of interest) like family. Do it! The world is your oyster!\n",
