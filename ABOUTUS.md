## About Us

### Our Goal

>Our mission is to crete happy home for Americans by recommending and presenting city

### Inspiration

>As with the instability brought by COVID-19, many people can't physically visit places to find the perfect city for them, if they are moving. Students are graduating and having to relocate for jobs, people are shifting closer to family and people are still having to move from places to places. There is a large number of people that need a city recommendation system upon their preferences, so they don't have to surf the internet for hours to find the perfect city, the code does it for them.

### Our Application

#### What is does 

>From the inputted preferences, it outputs the user a list of cities based on the initial recommendation. Also, it provides a one-stop-shop for your city searching needs.

#### How we built it

>For the first couple of hours, we invested heavily in acquiring data: we collected seven to eight large data sheets for use. We leveraged stream lite technology for the rapid development of a visualization tool. Furthermore, we performed a large scale of data wrangling and data formatting and filtering. The data engineer tasks were performed in various environments, such as Kaggle notebooks, VS Code, and Jupyter notebook. Also, we leveraged zip to the city library to convert and connect different datasheets. We used markdown pages to create an about us page on the website. We performed clustering and unsupervised ranking algorithms. However, we were unsuccessful in our ability to use the trained model for our recommendation system.
